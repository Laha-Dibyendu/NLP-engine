## NLP Project

This project contains NLP library code which runs with fast api, spacy library.

Through the api if we gave a sentence here, it can list down all the features along with synonym and antonyms based on our requirements.

## To run this Project : 

First create a virtual environment through `pipenv` using the command `pipenv shell`.

Then install all the requiremnets through this command : `pipenv install requirements.txt`

Now we are ready to run our project through this code `python api.py`

## In case you don't have PIPENV follow this below commands: 

* Open the project folder in the terminal. Create virtual environment.
    
    `python -m venv env`

* Activate the virtual environment

    `.\env\scripts\activate`

* Install all the requirements through 

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Run the `api.py` through this command

    `python api.py`
